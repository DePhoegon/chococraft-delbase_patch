Outside the Obvious thanks to the forge team, & all those that make forge modding possible.

Thanks to the Chococraft 4 team, and it would great to see that mod continue  while i keep a fork aside twisting it to what I would like to see in my pack(s)

Also Thanks to those whom help me test out some of my obscure logic and practical issues that I may not see.
